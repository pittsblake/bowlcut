# bowlCut

#Project Description

This a hair cut app where users can log in and see stylists in their area that are currently available to give a haircut. Once the User requests an appointment from a stylist then the stylist will get a notification to let them know they have a hair cut request and will then drive to the user's location and give a haircut.

  # bowlCut 2.0

  Authorization and Authentication needs to be added so that user and stylists can sign in and have their own profiles. I would like to bring in the Google Maps Api so that User's can see how far away the stylist is from them. Styling updates. Ability to add comments to each appointment that is saved in the User's profile so that new Stylists can see what kind of hair cut they like to get. Payment options need to be implemented.

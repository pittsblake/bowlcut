# bowlCut

#Project Description

This a hair cut app where customers can log in and see stylists in their area that are currently available to give a haircut. It's meant to be like an Uber but for haircuts. Once the customer requests an appointment from a stylist, the stylist will get a notification to let them know they have a hair cut request. The stylist can click on the notification and go to a messaging page where the stylist and customer can communicate. Once the haircut is finished then that appointment is logged on the customers profile, where they can see a list of all the appointments they have had and who gave them their haircut.

  # bowlCut 2.0

  Authorization and Authentication needs to be added so that user and stylists can sign in and have their own profiles. I would like to bring in the Google Maps Api so that User's can see how far away the stylist is from them. Styling updates. Ability to add comments to each appointment that is saved in the User's profile so that new Stylists can see what kind of hair cut they like to get. Payment options need to be implemented.
